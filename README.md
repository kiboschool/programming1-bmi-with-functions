# BMI Functions: Instructions

Define a function named `calculate_bmi` that takes in  weight and height as arguments, calculates the BMI, and returns it.

Make sure you round the returned value to 1 decimal point.

Write the code, then run the automated tests with `python3 test.py`

## Hints

* Your function must be named `calculate_bmi`.
* The BMI calculation is the same as your first BMI assignment. Feel free to look back at your code from that assignment for the formula.
* Your program doesn't have to have any output when you run it. Instead of testing the input and output of your program, the tests are looking just at the `calculate_bmi` function.
